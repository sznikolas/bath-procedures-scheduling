Bath procedures scheduling

This project can generate a timetable for patients in a bath complexum. The doctors and nurses can registrate in the system and can prescribe the treatments for their patients. 
After they selected the treatments the system will automaticaly generate a timetable considering the lenght and the numbers of the treatments, the available places. 
If the time is not acceptable for the patients we can change it manually. 
After the timetable is looking good we can print it and give it to the patient. The system save the used treatments and we can see a simlpy statistics about the procedures and about the patients treatments. 
The doctors have more access to the system and they can record the patient's details and complaints with comments.

For the preparation we used Spring Boot (Java), CSS, JavaScript, Heroku, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap.
